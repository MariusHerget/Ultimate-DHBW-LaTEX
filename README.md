## How to start
1. Rename the _dhbw-ultimate.tex_ file into your favorite file name (this won't the document name or title of your work).
2. Change the *DOCUMENT_NAME* variable in the **makefile** to the chosen file name (without .tex).
3. Run **\make init**. 
4. Change the Logo in the *images* to your company's logo.
5. Include own Frameworks in *ownFrameworks.tex*
6. Now you can create new files in *Content/*, edit the information in the main tex-file and start to work on your paper.
